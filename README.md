# Predicting Coral Reef Bleaching Using Time Series Models
Probability and Statistics Course Project - October 2024

## Project Overview
Coral bleaching is a severe environmental issue where corals expel the algae (*zooxanthellae*) living in their tissues, causing them to turn white. This process is often triggered by environmental stress—primarily rising **Sea Surface Temperatures (SST)**—and can lead to coral death, reducing marine biodiversity. This project analyzes historical coral bleaching data, identifies key environmental factors, and builds **time series forecasting models** to predict future bleaching events.

---

## Objectives
- Explore and preprocess coral bleaching datasets.
- Identify relationships between **SST**, **Solar Radiation**, and bleaching events.
- Build predictive models (**ARIMA, ARIMAX, ETS, VAR**) for SST.
- Determine bleaching risk based on forecasted SST values.
- Compare models using **RMSE** and **AIC** to select the best predictor.
